About PS Toolkit
================

PS Toolkit is a set of Javascript and HTML components designed to make building websites easier.  These components use Javascript to fill in some of the gaps in standard HTML (i.e., styling dropdown elements) or simplify the steps needed to create a reusable component (i.e., modal windows). As of version 1.0.1, PS Toolkit components have been optimized to run on native Javascirpt and no longer require jQuery.
